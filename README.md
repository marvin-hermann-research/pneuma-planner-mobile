## Project Description
This repository contains a Unity project implementing a simple calendar with adjustable recurring events as well as addable one-time events.  
The unique twist: a Discord server is used as the **database**, managed through a custom Discord bot that reads and writes .txt files directly in a channel.

## Motivation
Inspired by several YouTube videos on *"storing data in unorthodox ways"*, I set out to build my own calendar app using Discord as its database host.  
This was an experiment in combining creativity with technical exploration.

## Project Context / Scope
This project was created as a self-study initiative, driven purely by curiosity and a desire to experiment with Unity, C#, and Discord bot integration.  
It was never intended for production use and mainly reflects my early journey as a developer.

## Lessons Learned
- Discord server administration  
- Building and integrating a Discord bot in C#  
- Managing .txt-based data storage within Discord  
- Applying standard C# libraries in Unity projects

## Future / Possible Extensions
- Popup notifications for selected days

### Disclaimer
This project is **not intended for production use or installation**. Its purpose is solely to **showcase my personal learning progress** and provide a snapshot of my early development work.  

Expect experimental code, unconventional solutions, and rough edges. Today I would approach such a project very differently â€“ but I keep it online as an important **stepping stone** in my growth as a programmer.
